# The Design and Augmented Intelligence Lab
- project: "The Design and Augmented Intelligence Lab"
  role: "Research Assistant, supervised by Professor Salah Kalantari"
  duration: "Apr. 2024 — Sept. 2024"
  # url: "#"

    Designed and executed a mixed experimental study with 24 participants (12 deaf and 12 hearing). Evaluated interpreter image sizes as within-group variables and interpretation speed as between-group variables. Conducted subjective and objective evaluations with After-Scenario questionnaires, and utilized mixed-ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for analysis. Concluded larger image sizes improve comprehension for deaf viewers, while medium speed enhances satisfaction across both groups.

# Classification Algorithm to Identify AUV Fault Situations
- project: "Classification Algorithm to Identify AUV Fault Situations"
  role: "Course Project"

  description: |
    Developed and optimized a fault detection algorithm for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) using ANN, CNN, and RNN models. Enhanced RNN with GRU, achieving up to 97% accuracy. Applied data preprocessing techniques, including LabelEncoder, data slicing, and warping. Incorporated Cosine Annealing for learning rate decay and systematic parameter tuning, including dropout, batch normalization, and Xavier initialization.

# Modular Epidemic Transmission Simulation
- project: "Modular Epidemic Transmission Simulation"
  role: "Challenge Cup Project"
  duration: "Dec. 2022 — May 2023"
  # url: "#"
  description: |
    Upgraded the SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered) model to a SEIUR model, accounting for undetected or unreported cases. Used AnyLogic and Java to implement time-dependent parameter segmentation, improving model responsiveness to evolving epidemic conditions. Formulated new dynamic equations, applied piecewise linear parameters, and automated data-driven updates, significantly improving prediction accuracy in a 70-day simulation.

# Impact of Pie Chart Design on Performance and User Experience
- project: "Impact of Pie Chart Design on Performance and User Experience"
  role: "Course Project"
  duration: "Oct. 2022 — Jan. 2023"
  # url: "#"

  description: "Studied the effects of pie chart design variables on user performance and preferences with 16 participants. Conducted ANOVA and regression analysis in Python. Found that pie charts with percentages and internal labels improve efficiency, readability, and user satisfaction."

# Wisdom Elderly Care Social Research
- project: "Wisdom Elderly Care Social Research"
  role: "Social Practice Project"
  duration: "July 2022"
  # url: "#"
  description: "Conducted field research in elderly care institutions, interviewed over 30 stakeholders, and analyzed age-friendly technology and services like 'Time Bank' for solitary seniors. Delivered insights on technology integration in elderly care to the host institution."
